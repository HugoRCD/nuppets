## 🚀 About

Nuppets is a comprehensive hub designed to empower Nuxt and Vue developers. More than just a snippet collection, Nuppets brings together a curated set of development resources—including AI commands, practical code examples, and expert techniques—focusing on integrations with Raycast. While the platform is firmly centered around Raycast at the moment, support for additional providers (like VS Code) is on the roadmap, ensuring you always have the best tools to make your development more efficient.

## ✨ Features

-   📱 **Built around Raycast**: Developed with a focus on the Raycast ecosystem, with plans to support other providers in the future.
-   🎯 **Tailored for Nuxt and Vue**: Crafted specifically to address the needs and challenges of modern front-end development.
-   🔄 **Always Evolving**: Regular updates to keep pace with the ever-changing landscape of Nuxt and Vue.
-   🎨 **Easily Customizable**: Adaptable resources that integrate seamlessly into your workflow.
-   🤝 **Community-Powered**: Contributed by developers, for developers.

Actually, there is no support for VS Code yet. But it's on the roadmap!
