  ### What are AI Commands?

  AI Commands are a collection of powerful commands that can be used to enhance your workflow. They are powered by the [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) platform, which provides a unified interface for interacting with various tools and services.

  ### How to Use AI Commands

  To use AI Commands, simply open the Raycast search bar and type in the command you want to execute.
  For example, to generate a Zod schema for a `yml` file for Nuxt Content.
