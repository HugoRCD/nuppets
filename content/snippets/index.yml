    ## What are Snippets?

    Snippets are pre-written pieces of code that you can quickly insert into your project. Think of them as smart shortcuts that save you from typing repetitive code patterns.

    ### Why Nuppets?

    As Nuxt developers, we often find ourselves writing the same code structures:
      - Component scaffolding
      - Server handlers
      - Composables
      - Page layouts
      - Common utilities

    Nuppets eliminates this repetition. Just type a trigger (like `!sfc`), and watch as your boilerplate code appears instantly.

    ### Inspired by Raycast

    This project is heavily inspired by [snippets.ray.so](https://snippets.ray.so), a brilliant tool by the Raycast team. Their approach to developer experience has shaped how we think about productivity tools.
