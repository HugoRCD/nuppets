  ### What are Snippets?

  Snippets are pre-written pieces of code that you can quickly insert into your project. Think of them as smart shortcuts that save you from typing repetitive code patterns.

  ### Why Nuppets?

  As Nuxt developers, we often find ourselves writing the same code structures:
    - Component scaffolding
    - Server handlers
    - Composables
    - Page layouts
    - Common utilities

  Nuppets eliminates this repetition. Just type a trigger (like `!sfc`), and watch as your boilerplate code appears instantly.

  ### Inspired by Raycast

  This project is heavily inspired by [snippets.ray.so](https://snippets.ray.so), a brilliant tool by the Raycast team. Their approach to developer experience has shaped how we think about productivity tools.
